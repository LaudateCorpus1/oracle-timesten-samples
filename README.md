## Supported TimesTen Releases
In general these samples require a _minimum_ of **TimesTen 18.1.4.1.0** but our recommendation is to always use the most recent release available for your platform. Some specific samples may require a more recent timesTen release; any such requirement will be detailed in the sample's README file.
