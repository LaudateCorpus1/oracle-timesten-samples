<span class="PageTitle-navy">Managing User Accounts and Privileges</span>
<p>For users to access your TimesTen database, you must create user accounts and grant appropriate database access privileges to those accounts. 
A user account is identified by a user name and a password. Only the 
instance administrator and users with the system privilege <span class="codetext">ADMIN</span> can create user accounts.</p>

<p class="section1">Creating a User Account</p>
<p>To create a new database user, perform the following steps:</p>
<blockquote><ol type=a>
<li>
	<p>Enter <span class="codetext">ttisql</span> with DSN at the OS command prompt to launch <span class="codetext">ttIsql</span> and  connect to your database </p>
	<p class="codetext">ttIsql &lt;DSN&gt;</p>
</li><br/>
<li>
	<p>Use the SQL statement 
	<span class="codetext">CREATE USER</span>  to create a database user account.</p> 
	<p class="codetext">CREATE USER &lt;username&gt; identified by &lt;password&gt;;</p>
</li><br/>
</ol></blockquote>
<p class="section1">User Privileges</p>
<p>Once a user account has been created, the appropriate user privileges should be granted to the account. 
They should be granted based on their needs.  For example, an application developer needs privileges to insert into tables 
and to execute  stored procedures. However, a developer would not typically be allowed to perform administrative tasks 
such as backing up the database and removing user accounts.</p>
<p>There are two types of user privileges.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>1. System privileges</dt>
		<dd>These privileges give a user the ability to perform system-level activities across multiple objects in the database, 
		or to perform an action on any schema objects of a particular type.  For example, the system privilege 
		<span class="codetext">CREATE TABLE</span>
		permits a user to create tables in the schema associated with that user.</dd>
	<br/>
	<dt>2. Object privileges</dt>
		<dd>These privileges give a user the ability to perform a particular action on a specific schema object. 
		The privilege to delete rows from the <span class="codetext"> EMPLOYEES</span> table is an  example of object privileges. 
		The owner (the creator) of the object always has full privileges to the object.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>For a listing of  the available privileges, refer to the  
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/timesten/22.1/sql-reference/privileges1.html#GUID-E2D64E74-FDA0-419B-B3CC-594754E6AE7A" target="_blank" class="doclink">Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database 
SQL Reference</a>.</p>
<br/>

<p class="section1">Granting and Revoking Privileges</p>
<p>The SQL statements <span class="codetext">GRANT</span>  and 
<span class="codetext">REVOKE</span> enable system and object privileges to be granted to and revoked from database users. For example:</p>
<blockquote><ol type=a>
<li>
	<p>To grant the 
	<span class="codetext">CREATE TABLE</span> 
	privilege to a user called <span class="codetext">HR</span>, run the following command:
	<p class="codetext">GRANT CREATE TABLE to HR;</p>
</li><br/>
<li>
	<p>To revoke the <span class="codetext">DELETE</span> privilege on <span class="codetext">EMPLOYEES</span> from <span class="codetext">HR</span>, run the following command:
	<p class="codetext">REVOKE DELETE ON EMPLOYEES from HR;</p>
</li><br/>
</ol></blockquote>
