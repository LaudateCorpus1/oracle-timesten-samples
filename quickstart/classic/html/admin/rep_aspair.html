<span class="PageTitle-navy">Active Standby Pair<br/> with TimesTen In-Memory Database </span>
<p > An <span class="doclink">active standby pair</span> 
configuration includes an active database, a standby  database, and optional read-only subscriber databases. 
The standby database receives the updates from the active database, and forwards the changes to optional read-only subscriber databases. 
All updates go directly to the active  database. The standby database is also available for read-only applications, 
for example a  reporting server. </p>
<p >This section describes how you can set up and administer an   active standby pair. 
Before you can set up an active standby pair,  the TimesTen 18.1 database software needs to be installed on both 
the active and standby servers, and the instance administrator user name must be the same on   both installations. </p>

<p class="section1"> Setting Up an Active Standby Pair</p>
<p >Here is an overview of the configuration steps for setting up an active standby pair with a TimesTen in-memory database:</p>

	<td class="c0" >1.</td>
