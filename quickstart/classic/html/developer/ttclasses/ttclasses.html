<span class="PageTitle-navy">TTClasses Sample Programs</span>
<p class="normal"><strong>TTClasses </strong>provides a set of C++ classes and APIs for database developers to implement C++ applications to run on the Oracle TimesTen database. This page provides a listing of the sample programs using TTClasses. The goal is to help jump start developers who are new to TimesTen by providing a set of sample programs that demonstrate  the core features of the TimesTen in-memory database. </p>
<p class="normal">The following TTClasses sample programs are available in the <span class="codetext">quickstart/classic/sample_code/ttclasses</span> directory.</p>

    <td valign="top" class="normal">This sample program is a good starting template for projects that use   TTClasses.  It shows how to connect to and disconnect from a TimesTen database   and how to prepare, bind, execute, fetch and close SQL statements.  Examples of   TTClasses exception handling and timing SQL operations for both serializable and   committed read transactions are shown. </td>

	This program shows how to list or remove XLA bookmarks in the database. This program requires a user with ADMIN privilege to run because only the administrator is allowed to see all bookmarks in the system. A user with the XLA privilege is allowed to list or remove his/her own bookmark. <br />
      <br />
      Unwanted bookmarks that are preventing transaction log files from being purged can create operational issues on the system and should be removed. <br />
      <br />
      The &quot;list&quot; option is the default option for running the program without any input. For each XLA bookmark found in the system, the program lists the    bookmark name, its LSN and whether the bookmark is holding transaction logs.  <br />
      <br />
      The &quot;remove&quot; option   allows the user to delete the XLA bookmark via its bookmark name.  The &quot;removeall&quot; option allows all of the bookmarks to be deleted.  Bookmarks can only be deleted when not in use.    </td>

    This program shows how to create persistent XLA bookmark and monitor and process changes on the specified table. The program displays the change records processed and the operations that were performed on the table (insert, update, or delete) to cause the change.  <br />

	<br />
	This program shows how to subscribe to XLA events on multiple tables of   interest (in this case three). This program monitors changes to  three tables: MYTABLE, ICF and ABC.<br />
      <br />
      The column names and   their values are shown for every row affected by the transaction's inserts,   updates and deletes.  To create the transactional workload, a ttIsql session or   a TimesTen user application can perform the transactions to the MYTABLE, ICF   and/or ABC tables. <br />

      This program is an example of an XLA subscriber which only   has the permission to see the changes to the table of interest, but not to   access the table of interest itself. The program requires a user with XLA privilege to run.<br />    </td>
