<p class="section1"><strong>Create Appropriate Indexes</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The  TimesTen in-memory database has a cost-based optimizer. The optimizer chooses the best plan for query execution. Knowing how many indexes to create for good database performance  is not always easy, but it's generally straight forward with proper review of the query plans.</p>
<p class="normal">The TimesTen database supports two types of indexes: hash  index and range index. Hash index is used for exact match lookups, and range index is used for range lookups. A well-tuned hash index is faster than the  corresponding range index for exact match lookups, but hash indexes cannot be  used for range queries. Range indexes can be used for both exact match and  range lookups, and for sorts, such as for SQL queries involving ORDER BY, GROUP  BY or DISTINCT).</p>
<p class="normal"><b>1. Hash Index</b><br />
  If you specify a unique hash index, be sure to  set the index with appropriate size. Use the “PAGES=” option of the CREATE  TABLE statement to specify the expected size of the table. Divide the number of  rows expected in the table by 256 for the number of pages to specify. Example:</p>
<blockquote class="codetext">CREATE  TABLE EMP (<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;ID     NUMBER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;NAME   VARCHAR2(100)<br />
  ) UNIQUE  HASH ON (ID) PAGES=500; </blockquote>
<p class="normal">Hash indexes provide better performance over range  indexes for equality predicates in cases where either index can be used.  However, hash indexes require more space than range indexes. Specifying too  many pages for the index wastes space. Specifying too few pages hurts the  performance because of hash buckets overflow. Hash indexes that are  in-appropriately sized can be much slower than a range index. Also, i<span class="normal">f  your table content increased significantly, you should resize your hash index;  this is done with the ALTER TABLE statement.</span><br />   
   </p>
    <p class="normal"><b>2. Range Index</b><br />
    If you don’t specify a unique hash index on your primary key, a range index is automatically created for you.
      <br />
      <br />
      A new range index (<span class="codetext">RangeIndexType</span>=0) - B-tree indexing capability featuring optimistic concurrency control provides increased scalability for write-intensive applications. This range index feature provides better throughput with higher numbers of concurrent writers, and is ideal for applications with very high volumes of insert and update transactions running in modern computing architectures with many processing cores.<br />
      <br />
In 22.1 release,  B-Tree index is used by default. All the range index [<span class="codetext">Create Index Table_Idx</span> ] will be created as B-Tree indexes for all tables. </p>     
    <p class="normal"><b>TimesTen Index Advisor</b> is a tool that evaluates a given SQL workload and recommends optimal indexes to  improve the performance of  the associated queries. For more information on Index Advisor, refer to the section on <a href="../tools/index_advisor.html">How to Run the TimesTen Index Adviso</a>r. <br />
</p>
<p class="section1">Update Statistics</p>
<p class="normal">The TimesTen query optimizer generally chooses good query  plans. However, the optimizer needs additional information about the tables  involved in complex queries in order to choose good plans. </p>
<p class="normal">Table statistics are an essential aid to the optimizer in  choosing a good plan. By knowing the number of rows and data distribution of  column values for a table, the optimizer has a much better chance of choosing  an efficient query plan to access that table.</p>
<p class="normal">Generally, it is  a good idea to update statistics on all  tables in your database before preparing queries that access those tables.<br />
  If you update statistics on your tables before they are  populated, then the queries are optimized with the assumption that the tables  contain no rows (or very few rows). If you later populate your tables with  millions of rows and then execute the queries, the plans that worked well for  tables containing few rows may now be very slow as the optimization was not  done for the current set of data in the table. </p>
<p class="normal">For optimal  performance, you should update statistics on your tables to reflect the current  population in the tables, in particular, after you have added or deleted a significant  number of rows in the tables. You should prepare your queries after you have  updated the table statistics.</p>
<p class="normal">For more information about updating statistics,  consult the descriptions of  the built-in  procedures <strong><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/timesten/22.1/database-reference/built-procedures.html#GUID-2FEC9A3D-F5DF-4151-BB2E-6C8313D1A806" target="_blank" class="doclink">ttOptUpdateStats</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/timesten/22.1/database-reference/built-procedures.html#GUID-FC0277FE-88C2-4076-ACF8-729E9131D9A8" target="_blank" class="doclink">ttOptEstimateStats</a></strong> in the “Built-In Procedures” section in the Reference manual.</p>
<p class="section1">Review Query Plan and Act Accordingly</p>
<p class="normal">If you find that a specific query runs more slowly than  expected, it is possible that the TimesTen optimizer is not choosing the  optimal query plan to answer that query. You should generate the query plan and  review it. The <em><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/timesten/22.1/operations/timesten-query-optimizer.html#GUID-9F275CEC-3B26-46BB-B073-26F56EB082A4" target="_blank" class="doclink">Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database Operations Guide</a></em> has detailed documentation on how to  generate a query plan and how to view the plan.<br />
</p>
<p class="normal">To display the optimizer plan from the <strong>ttIsql</strong> command line utility, use the  commands:</p>
<p class="normal">autocommit 0;<br />
  showplan 1;<br />
</p>
<p class="normal">When reviewing the query plan, pay attention to the  predicates that are participating in the query evaluation but are not indexed.  If you can create an index for the non-indexed predicates, it helps your query  performance. Now let's review a sample query.</p>
<p class="normal">In the example below, we extracted one of the steps in a  test query where the main table (SHIPMENT)  is relatively big. It has over 10 million rows. When we first ran the query, it  took about 800 seconds to complete, which was too slow and not what was  expected. We then generated the query plan and saw that one of the steps had  the following plan:: </p>
<blockquote class="codetext">STEP:    10<br />
  LEVEL:     8<br />
  OPERATION:  TblLkRangeScan<br />
  TBLNAME:    SHIPMENT<br />
  IXNAME:    SHIPMENT_IDX1<br />
  <strong>INDEXED:  &nbsp;&lt;NULL&gt;<br />
  </strong><strong>NOT  INDEXED</strong>:  TBL1.OB_FLG &lt;&gt; 'Y' <br />
  AND  TBL1.SHIPMENT_ID = CLIENT.SHIPMENT_ID <br />
  AND  TBL1.SHIPMENT_QUAL = CLIENT.SHIPMENT_QUAL<br />
  AND  TBL1.CARRIER = CLIENT.CARRIER<br />
  AND TBL1.ROLE = 'Y' <br />
</blockquote>
<p class="normal">Several predicates were listed in the “NOT INDEXED” line, and in  fact, there were no predicates listed in the “INDEXED”  line. We did not have an index for the SHIPMENT_ID,  SHIPMENT_QUAL and the CARRIER  columns and the optimizer had to scan the entire table to evaluate each of the  predicates. We fixed the issue by creating an index for those 3 columns, and we  got a much improved plan for step 10 as shown below: </p>
<blockquote class="codetext">STEP:    10<br />
  LEVEL:     8<br />
  OPERATION:  RowLkRangeScan<br />
  TBLNAME:    SHIPMENT<br />
  IXNAME:    SHIPMENT_IDX0<br />
  <strong>INDEXED</strong>:  &nbsp;TBL1.SHIPMENT_ID = CLIENT.SHIPMENT_ID <br />
  AND  TBL1.SHIPMENT_QUAL = CLIENT.SHIPMENT_QUAL <br />
  AND  TBL1.CARRIER = CLIENT.CARRIER<br />
  <strong>NOT-INDEXED</strong>:   TBL1.OB_FLG &lt;&gt; 'Y' AND TBL1.ROLE =  'Y'<br />
</blockquote>
<p class="normal">This is a much better plan. The optimizer chooses the row  lock with the appropriate index to evaluate the predicates, resulting in a 400  times improvement in the query time. The modified query ran for 2 seconds  (instead of 800 seconds prior to the change). </p>
<p class="normal">As  with all performance tuning, your mileage varies. The important point here is  that you should take the time to read the query plan and make necessary changes  for better query performance.</p>
