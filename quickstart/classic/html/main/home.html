<p>Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database (TimesTen) is a memory-optimized relational database that provides applications with 
the instant responsiveness and very high throughput required by today's real-time enterprises in a wide range of industries. 
A TimesTen database resides entirely in memory at run time and is persisted to disk storage for the ability to recover and restart.  
Applications access the TimesTen database using the JDBC, ODBC, OCI and/or Pro*C/C++ interfaces. TimesTen  is extremely fast 
and it is fully transactional, persistent, and highly available with transactional replication. </p>
<p>TimesTen is typically deployed in the middle-tier with the applications; it can be run as a stand-alone database 
or as an Application-Tier Database Cache (TimesTen Cache) for an Oracle database. Using  TimesTen Cache provides applications 
the power of SQL, the speed of RAM and the reliability of a proven product with  automatic data synchronization 
between theTimesTen cache tables and the back-end Oracle database.</p>

<p> The Quick Start Guide includes the following areas of information to help you get started quickly:</p>

	<dt><b>1. <a href="../admin/admin.html">CONFIGURATION and SETUP</a></b></dt>
		<ul>
		  <li>Provides tutorials on how to properly install and manage TimesTen instances, as well as how to create and configure TimesTen databases, 
		set up user accounts and privileges, start and stop TimesTen database processes, connect to a TimesTen database, 
		and execute a variety of database operations.  In addition, you will learn how to use TimesTen Cache
		to configure cache groups in the middle tier for caching a subset of your Oracle database, 
		how to configure TimesTen Replication to achieve high availability in the middle tier, 
		and how to configure your cache database with a Java EE Application Server and OR mapping tools.  </li>
