# A Sample ODBC Driver Manager

This directory contains the source code for a TimesTen specific Driver Manager. This can be used to enable C/ODBC programs to simultaneously use boith direct mode and client/server connections to a TimesTen database (which is not possible without a Driver Manager).

The sample Driver Manager is focussed on optimal performance while still allowing full access to all TimesTen features. For more information and build instructions see the [User Guide](./TTDMUserGuide.md).

**NOTE:**  TTDM only supports a limited number of platforms.
