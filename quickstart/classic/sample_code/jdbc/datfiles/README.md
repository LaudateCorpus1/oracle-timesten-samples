# Data files for JDBC Sample Programs

This directory holds the data files read by the 'level#.java' JDBC sample programs that simulate the operation of a simple order-processing database.

The 'level#.java' JDBC sample programs can be found in the **quickstart/classic/sample_code/jdbc** directory. 

They impact the following database tables, all of which are part of the **sampledb** schema:

````
appuser.product
appuser.inventory
appuser.customer
appuser.orders
appuser.order_item
````

The input1.dat, input2.dat, and input3.dat files are used to add, delete, and modify the data in the demo schema.

To compile and run the JDBC sample programs, follow the instructions listed in the [quickstart/classic/sample\_code/jdbc/README.md](../README.md) file.
