This program implements a multi-user throughput benchmark using
direct connection mode.

Usage:

  tptbm {-h | -help}
  tptbm [-proc <nprocs>] [-read <nreads>] [-insert <nins>] [-delete <ndels>]
     [-throttle <n>] [{-xact <xacts> | -sec <seconds> [-ramp <rseconds>]}]
     [-ops <ops>] [-key <keys>] [-range] [-iso <level>] [-seed <seed>]
     [-build] [-nobuild] [-v <level>]
     [<DSN> | -connstr <connection-string>]

  -h                  Prints this message and exits.
  -help               Same as -h.
  -V                  Prints version number and exits.
  -proc    <nprocs>   Specifies that <nprocs> is the number of concurrent
                      processes. The default is 1.
  -read    <nreads>   Specifies that <nreads> is the percentage of read-only
                      transactions. The default is 80.
  -insert  <nins>     Specifies that <nins> is the percentage of insert
                      transactions. The default is 0.
  -delete  <ndels>    Specifies that <ndels> is the percentage of delete
                      transactions. The default is 0.
  -xact    <xacts>    Specifies that <xacts> is the number of transactions
                      that each process should run. The default is 10000.
  -sec     <seconds>  Specifies that <seconds> is the test duration.
                      that each process should run. Default is to run in
                      transaction mode (-xact).
  -ramp  <rseconds>   Specifies that <rseconds> is the ramp up time in duration
                      mode (-sec). Default is 5.
  -ops     <ops>      Operations per transaction.  The default is 1.
                      In the special case where 0 is specified, no commit
                      is done. This may be useful for read-only testing.
  -key     <keys>     Specifies the number of records (squared) to initially
                      populate in the database. The minimum value is 10
                      and the default is 100 (100**2 rows). The same
                      value should be specified at both build and run time.
  -range              Use a range index for the primary key instead of a hash
                      index.
  -iso     <level>    Locking isolation level
                         0 = serializable
                         1 = read-committed (default)
  -seed    <seed>     Specifies that <seed> should be the seed for the
                      random number generator. Must be > 0, default is 1.
  -throttle <n>       Throttle each process to <n> operations per second.
                      Must be > 0. The default is no throttle.
  -build              Only build the database, do not run the benchmark. Only
                      the '-key' and '-range' parameters are relevant.
  -nobuild            Only run the benchmark, do not build the database.
                      The '-range' parameter is not relevant.
  -v <level>          Verbosity level
                         0 = errors only
                         1 = results only
                         2 = results and some status messages (default)
                         3 = all messages

If no DSN or connection string is specified, the default is
  "DSN=sampledb;UID=appuser".

The percentage of update operations is 100 minus the percentages of reads,
inserts and deletes.
